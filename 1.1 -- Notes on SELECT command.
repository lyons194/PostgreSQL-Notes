Notes on "Select".

Sample of a SELECT statement:

  -->  SELECT 'column1', 'column2', ... FROM 'table_name'

If you want to select data from multiple columns, separate the column names with commas.

If you want to select data from all available columns, use an asterisk.

You indicate the table name after the FROM keyword.

SQL is case-insensitive.  SQL keywords are usually in upper-case font in order to make the code easier to read.
