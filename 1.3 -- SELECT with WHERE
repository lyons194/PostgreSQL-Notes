Using SELECT with WHERE.

Syntax example:

->  SELECT 'column1', 'column2',... 'columnN'
    FROM 'table_name'
    WHERE 'conditions';
    

The WHERE clause appears right after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.

The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement.

SELECT WHERE statements:

Operator		Description

 =			'Equal'
 >			'Greater Than'
 <			'Less Than'
 >=			'Greater or Equal Than'
 <=			'Less or Equal Than'
 <> or !=		'Not Equal'
 AND			'logical operator AND'
 OR			'logical operator OR'

Udemy Course example:

'You want to select every customer with the first name "Jamie".  This example will use the WHERE clause and the = operator.'

SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Jamie';

*You can also use logical operators to further specify the search.

SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Jamie' AND last_name = 'Rice';
