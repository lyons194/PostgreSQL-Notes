'HAVING' clause assessment.

Q1:	'We want to know which customers are eligible for a platinum credit card.  The requirements are that the customer has at least a total of 40 transaction payments.  What customers are eligible for the credit card?'


A1:	My initial answer:

	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(rental_id)
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id
	HAVING COUNT(rental_id) >= 40;
	
	
*The correct answer given in the lecture solution slides had the "amount" column in place of the "rental_id" column which appeared in my initial answer.  However, my initial answer yielded the same answer as the lecture solution.

Q2:	'When grouped by rating, what movie ratings have an average rental duration of more than five days?'


A1:	My initial answer:

	SELECT rating, AVG(rental_duration)
	FROM film
	GROUP BY rating
	HAVING AVG(rental_duration) > 5;
	
	
	-->  Correct!
