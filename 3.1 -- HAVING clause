The 'HAVING' statement.


---------------


-HAVING is often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter group rows that do not specify a certain condition.


---------------


Example:

SELECT column_1, aggregate_function(column_2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_1
HAVING condition;


---------------


-The HAVING clause sets the condition for group rows created by the GROUP BY clause after the GROUP BY clause applies while the WHERE clause sets the condition for individual rows before the GROUP BY clause applies.

-This is the main difference between the HAVING and WHERE clauses.


---------------


Example:

SELECT customer_id SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 200;


---------------


-Recall that you use the HAVING clause after you use GROUP BY.


---------------


Example:

SELECT store_id, COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 300;



Example:

SELECT rating, AVG(rental_rate)
FROM film
WHERE rating IN('R', 'G', 'PG')
GROUP BY rating
HAVING AVG(rental_rate) < 3;
