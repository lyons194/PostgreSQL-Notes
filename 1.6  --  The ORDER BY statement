Notes regarding the 'ORDER BY' statement.

-When you query data from a table, PostgreSQL returns the rows in the order that they were inserted into that table.

-In order to sort the result, you use the ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement.

-The ORDER BY clause allows you to sort the rows returned from the SELECT statement in ascending or descending order, based on the criteria specified.


---------------

Example of a PostgreSQL query that uses the ORDER BY statement, with ascending order specification:

SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name_1 ASC;


---------------


Example of a PostgreSQL query that uses the ORDER BY statement, with descending order specification:

SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name_1 DESC;


---------------

-Note:  When using ascending/descending specifications, only use one at a time.

-Use ASC to sort the result set in ascending order and DESC to sort the result set in descending order.

-If you leave this specification spot blank, the ORDER BY clause will return the values
