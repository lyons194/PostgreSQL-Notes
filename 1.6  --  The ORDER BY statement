Notes regarding the 'ORDER BY' statement.

-When you query data from a table, PostgreSQL returns the rows in the order that they were inserted into that table.

-In order to sort the result, you use the ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement.

-The ORDER BY clause allows you to sort the rows returned from the SELECT statement in ascending or descending order, based on the criteria specified.


---------------

Example of a PostgreSQL query that uses the ORDER BY statement, with ascending order specification:

SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name_1 ASC;


---------------


Example of a PostgreSQL query that uses the ORDER BY statement, with descending order specification:

SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name_1 DESC;


---------------


-Note:  When using ascending/descending specifications, only use one at a time.

-Use ASC to sort the result set in ascending order and DESC to sort the result set in descending order.

-If you leave this specification spot blank, the ORDER BY clause will return the values in ascending order by default.


---------------


Example:

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
ORDER BY last_name DESC;


---------------


-Note:  In the above example, the query is 'ordered by' the last_name variable; when doing this in PostgreSQL, this command specifies which column to rearrange.


---------------


Another ORDER BY example query:


SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
ORDER BY first_name ASC,
last_name DESC;


---------------


-The above example shows how you can use the ORDER BY statement on multiple columns when querying a table.


---------------


Another ORDER BY example query:

SELECT first_name
FROM customer
ORDER BY last_name;


---------------


-Note:  MySQL/Oracle may not let you execute the above query sample.


---------------


Another ORDER BY example query:

SELECT customer_id, amount
FROM payment
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 10;


---------------


-Note:  It is good practice to select the column that you're ordering by.


---------------


Another ORDER BY example query:

SELECT film_id, title
FROM film
ORDER BY film_id ASC
LIMIT 5;


---------------


-Note:  This example find the titles of the first five film id's of the Udemy sample database.
