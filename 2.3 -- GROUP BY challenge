#GROUP BY sample problems.

Q1:  'What was the total amount of revenue generated by staff members via DVD rentals?'

A1:	My initial answer:

	SELECT staff_id, SUM(amount)
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY staff_id;
	
	The correct answer:
	
	SELECT staff_id, COUNT(amount), SUM(amount)
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY staff_id;
	
Note:  My initial answer is not necessarily incorrect.  On the following page, there is another question.  As it turns out, the two questions were asked as one question but I mistakenly ran the command as two separate commands.
