The BETWEEN statement.

-We use the BETWEEN operator to match a value against a range of values.


---------------

Example:

value BETWEEN low AND high;


---------------


Note:  You can rewrite the BETWEEN operator by using the grater than or equal to operatir or the less than equal operator as the following statement:


---------------


Example:

value >= low AND value <= high;


A.K.A.:

value < low OR value > high;


Example:


SELECT customer_id, amount
FROM payment
WHERE amount BETWEEN 8 AND 9;


EXample:


SELECT amount, payment_date
FROM payment
WHERE payment_date BETWEEN '2002-02-07' AND '2002-02-15'
