"GROUP BY"

-This is one of the most useful tools in SQL!

-The GROUP BY clause divides the rows returned by the SELECT statement into groups.

-For each group, you can apply an aggregate function, i.e.:

    -Calculating the sum of items.
    -Count the number of items in the groups.


---------------

Example 1:

SELECT column_1, aggregate_function(column_2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_1;


---------------


Example 2:

SELECT customer_id
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id;


---------------


-In the above example, the GROUP BY command acts like a DISTINCT command.

-GROUP BY commands are particularly useful when used with aggregate functions.


---------------


Example 3:

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id;


---------------


-You can use ORDER BY commands with GROUP BY commands.


---------------


Example 4:


SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;


---------------


Example 5:

SELECT staff_id, COUNT(payment_id)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;


---------------


Example 6:

SELECT rating, COUNT(rating)
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;
