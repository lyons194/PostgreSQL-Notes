The 'IN' Statement.

-You can use the IN operator with the WHERE clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values.

-The syntax of the IN operator is as follows:


---------------


Example:  value IN(value1, value2...)


---------------


-The expression returns True is the value matches any value in the list, i.e., value1, value2, etc.

-The list of values is not limited to a list of numbers or strings but also a result set of a SELECT statement as shown in the following example:


---------------


Example:

value IN(SELECT value FROM table_name);


---------------


-Note:  The above example is an example of a 'subquery', as there is a SELECT FROM statement within the IN operator.

-You can also use 'NOT IN', which verifies whether a value is not within a list of values.
