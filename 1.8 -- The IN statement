The 'IN' Statement.

-You can use the IN operator with the WHERE clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values.

-The syntax of the IN operator is as follows:


---------------


Example:  value IN(value1, value2...)


---------------


-The expression returns True is the value matches any value in the list, i.e., value1, value2, etc.

-The list of values is not limited to a list of numbers or strings but also a result set of a SELECT statement as shown in the following example:


---------------


Example:

value IN(SELECT value FROM table_name);


---------------


-Note:  The above example is an example of a 'subquery', as there is a SELECT FROM statement within the IN operator.

-You can also use 'NOT IN', which verifies whether a value is not within a list of values.


---------------

Example:

SELECT customer_id, rental_id, return_date
FROM rental
WHERE customer_id IN(1,2)
ORDER BY return_date DESC;


---------------


-Recall:  You can also use NOT IN().

-The example below is the same query as the one above, but written out differently:


---------------

Example:

SELECT customer_id, rental_id, return_date
FROM rental
WHERE customer_id = 1
OR customer_id = 2
ORDER BY return_date DESC;


---------------


-As we can see from the above example, the IN() operator expedites the code.


---------------


Example:

SELECT * FROM payment
WHERE amount IN(7.99, 8.99);


---------------


-The above example returns all files that have either an 'amount' variable value of $7.99 or $8.99.
