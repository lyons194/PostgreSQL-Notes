The first general challenge / test of PostgreSQL knowledge.

This section consists of test problems and my answers to said problems.

Q1.  "How many payment transactions were greater than $5.00?"

A1:


SELECT COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5.99;


-->  My initial answer proved to be correct!

Q2:  "How many actors have a first name that starts with the letter 'P'?"

A2:  SELECT COUNT(first_name)
     FROM customer
     WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%';
     
Comments: My initial answer above was incorrect.

I was not sure how to find the actor data because I was not sure what table it existed in.

Using the modulo sign, I queried all of the first names that began with 'P'.  If I would have put the modulo sign before the letter P, it would have given me all of the names that end with P.

Therefore, the correct answer to this question is:

     SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM actor
     WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%';

Q3: 'How many unique districts are the customers from?'

A3:  My initial answer:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district)
FROM address;


The correct answer:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(district))
FROM address;


Note:  The two answers: my initial answer and the 'correct' answer, yielded the same number.  However, it is a good idea to use the parentheses, just to err on the side of caution.

Q4:  'Retrieve the list of names for those distinct districts from the previous question.


A4:  My initial answer:

SELECT DISTINCT(district)
FROM address;


This answer is correct!


---------------


Q5:  'How many films have a rating of R and a replacement cost between $5 and $15?'

A5:  My initial answer:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'R'
AND replacement_cost >= 5
AND replacement_cost <= 15;


-Note:  Initially, for the first line in my initial query, I wrote: SELECT COUNT(rating, replacement_cost) FROM film.  However, when the command had the above code for its first line, it yielded an error message.


THE CORRECT SOLUTION:

SELECT (*) FROM film
WHERE rating = 'R'
AND replacement_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 15;


-Though the soluton is different than what I initially wrote, it yields the same result.  Remember that the BETWEEN statement can expedite/simplify queries.

-When you use the SELECT(*) FROM table_name, you're querying the number of rows that will be returned (sometimes tailored to specified parameters listed below it).
