The first general challenge / test of PostgreSQL knowledge.

This section consists of test problems and my answers to said problems.

Q1.  "How many payment transactions were greater than $5.00?"

A1:


SELECT COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5.99;


-->  My initial answer proved to be correct!

Q2:  "How many actors have a first name that starts with the letter 'P'?"

A2:  SELECT COUNT(first_name)
     FROM customer
     WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%';
     
Comments: My initial answer above was incorrect.

I was not sure how to find the actor data because I was not sure what table it existed in.

Using the modulo sign, I queried all of the first names that began with 'P'.  If I would have put the modulo sign before the letter P, it would have given me all of the names that end with P.

Therefore, the correct answer to this question is:

     SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM actor
     WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%';
