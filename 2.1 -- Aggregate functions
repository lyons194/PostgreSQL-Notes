Lecture 40:  Aggregate functions.

-Examples of aggregate functions:
    ->  MIN
    ->  MAX
    ->  AVG
    ->  SUM
    ->  COUNT

-Aggregate functions combine data into a single value.


---------------

An example of an aggregate function:

SELECT AVG(amount) FROM payment;


-The above code yields the average value for the specified data column (amount) for the specified table (payment).

-In case you receive a value that is an irrational number, you can use the ROUND command to round to a certain decimal place:


SELECT ROUND(AVG(amount), 2)
FROM payment;


-Because there is a "2" in the code, the ROUND function will round the answer to two decimal places.
